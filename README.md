# Ludum Dare 35 Starting Point

This is a fork of sjrd's [scalajs-phaser-demo](https://github.com/sjrd/scalajs-phaser-demo) project. 

I'm going to modify it for my needs and then share it with the community before starting my project
on Friday.

## Changes

Added Phaser.Sound and load.audio to Phaser.scala, pretty easy to do.

## Notes

Assets (images, sounds, music, etc) should be copied to the /server/src/main/resources/assets directory.

The client-side code is /client/src/main/scala/pairs.client/PairsClient.scala

The server-side code is /server/src/main/scala/pairs.server/Server.scala
