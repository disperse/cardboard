# Ludum Dare <s>35</s> 36 Starting Point

This is a fork of sjrd's [scalajs-phaser-demo](https://github.com/sjrd/scalajs-phaser-demo) project. 

I'm going to modify it for my needs and then share it with the community before starting my project
on Friday.

I didn't finish my game but now have some code to start with for the next Ludum Dare.

## Changes

Moved from Phaser to native Canvas

## Notes

Assets (images, sounds, music, etc) should be copied to the /server/src/main/resources/assets directory.

The client-side code is /client/src/main/scala/cardboard.client/CardboardClient.scala

The server-side code is /server/src/main/scala/cardboard.server/Server.scala
